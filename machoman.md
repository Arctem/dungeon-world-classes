### Starting Moves
#### Bend Bars, Lift Gates (Destroyer)
When you use pure strength to destroy an inanimate obstacle, roll+STR. On a 10+, choose three. On a 7-9, choose two:
* It doesn't make an inordinate amount of noise.
* It doesn't take a very long time.
* Nothing you value is damaged.
* You can fix the thing again without a lot of effort.

#### Fists of Fury (Martial Hero)
You are never unarmed—your body, and each of your limbs, is a weapon (hand, 0 weight), just as good as any other.

#### Perfect Poise (Acrobat)
You never lose your balance, even on a high wire, or fall without being pushed. **If you are pushed**, as long as there is something to break your fall, you can defy danger with DEX to use it and take no damage.

And either one of these two moves:

#### Unencumbered, Unharmed (Strongarm)
**So long as you are below your Load and neither wear armour nor carry a shield**, take +1 armour

#### The Upper Hand (Strongarm)
You are so strong you take +1 ongoing to last breath rolls. **When you take your last breath*, on a 7-9, you make an offer to Death in return for your life. If Death accepts, she will return you to life. If not, you die.


### Advanced Moves
When you gain a level from 2-5, you may choose from these moves:

#### Blood Ill-Tempered (Destroyer)
**When a foe deals damage to you**, your next attack against them deals +1d4 damage.

#### Improvised Weapon
Anything solid that you can pick up, you can use as a weapon with the appropriate range (usually hand).

#### Interrogator (Destroyer, Strongarm)
**When you parley using threats of impending violence as leverage**, you may use STR instead of CHA.

#### My Love for You is Like a Truck (Strongarm)
**When you perform a feat of strength**, name someone present whom you have impressed and take +1 forward to parley with them.

#### Nine Lives (Acrobat)
*Requires: Perfect Poise*
**When you fall**, if there is something that could possible break your fall, it does so and you take no damage.

#### Samson (Destroyer, Strongarm)
You may take a debility to immediately break free of any physical or mental restraint.

#### Smash! (Strongarm)
**When you hack and slash**, on a 12+, deal your damage and choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a limb): they lose it.

#### Submission Hold (Strongarm)
**When you get your hands on someone**, your next attack against them deals +1d4 damage.

#### Swashbuckler (Acrobat)
**When you use your surroundings to perform a flamboyant acrobatic maneuver**, choose one outcome, in addition to anything else that may happen:
* You grab something undefended. Now it's yours!
* You knock someone down or off-balance.
* You move from where you are to somewhere else in sight or in reach without difficulty.

#### The Bigger They Are (Bounty Hunter)
**When you spout lore about someone you know or you’ve heard of before** (your call), on a hit, you can also ask the GM either of these questions and then take +1 forward when acting on the answer.
* How could they be taken?
* What are they worth and to whom?

---
When you gain a level from 6-10, you may choose from these moves as well as the level 2-5 moves:

#### Considered It Already (Bounty Hunter)
**When you spout lore about someone you know or you’ve heard of before** (your call), on a hit, you can also ask the GM both of these questions and then take +1 forward when acting on the answer.
* How could they be taken?
* What are they worth and to whom?

#### Death Defying Grace (Acrobat)
**When you defy danger using acrobatic maneuvers**, on a 7-9, you can choose not to personally suffer the consequences. Someone or something else, possibly your equipment but certainly not you, suffers the consequences instead.

#### Fire in the Blood (Destroyer)
*Replaces: Blood Ill-Tempered*  
**When a foe deals damage to you**, your next attack against them deals +1d8 damage.

#### Hands Like a Vise (Strongarm)
*Replaces: Submission Hold*  
**When you get your hands on someone**, your next attack against them deals +1d8 damage.

#### Heroic Swashbuckler (Acrobat)
*Replaces: Swashbuckler*  
**When you use your surroundings to perform a flamboyant acrobatic maneuver**, choose one outcome, in addition to anything else that may happen:
* You grab something, even if someone else is holding it. Now it's yours!
* You knock someone down or off-balance. You may deal damage equal to your level.
* You move from where you are to somewhere else in sight or in reach without difficulty. You may take someone else with you.

#### Mark of Might (Strongarm)
**When you take this move and spend some uninterrupted time reflecting on your past glories**, you may mark yourself with a symbol of your power (a long braid tied with bells, ritual scars, tattoos, etc). Any intelligent mortal creature who sees this symbol knows instinctively  that you are a force to be reckoned with an treats you appropriately.

#### No Holds Barred (Custom)
**When you wield an improvised weapon**, it gains the forceful and messy tags.

#### Serpentine (Acrobat)
**When you employ acrobatics, deft maneuvers, or quick reflexes**, you can defend with DEX instead of CON.

#### Superior Warrior (Destroyer)
When you **hack and slash**, on a 12+, you deal your damage, avoid their attack, and impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy.

#### Too Brave to Die (Strongarm)
*Requires: Unencumbered, Unharmed or The Upper Hand*  
You had only one before, now you have both Unencumbered, Unharmed and The Upper Hand.
